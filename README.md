# SwiftDataSampleApp

This is an experimental project created for hands-on learning and exploration of **SwiftData** in iOS development.

The goal of this app is to understand the basics of SwiftData, including data modeling, persistence, and integrating it into a SwiftUI-based application.

Feel free to explore, test, and modify as part of your SwiftData learning journey!
